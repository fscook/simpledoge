      Just a heads up, we had ~5 min offline(~22:28-22:33 GMT) when we hit the max file descriptor limit. We don't 
      expect this to be a continuing issue as we've increased the descriptor limit by about 15x, but 
      we'll continue to monitor/adjust it as necessary.

      Check out <a href="http://www.simplevert.com">Simple Vert</a> if you're interested
      in mining vertcoin. You'll need to upgrade <a href="https://github.com/icook/ppagent#powerpool-agent">PPAgent</a> to
      work with the new pool.
